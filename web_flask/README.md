# 0x04. AirBnB Clone - Web Framework

Working with Flask and Jinja2 for the first time, this was an AirBnB side project. I started fusing the earlier written static HTML/CSS web pages with the back-end storage engine in this project.

I get accustomed to using Flask by working on files 0 through 6. From file 7 onward, creating Jinja templates based on the HBnB HTML pages steadily became more difficult.
